                    <p>
                        This week on All Things Nintendo, former Game Informer video producer and founder of MinnMax Ben
                        Hanson joins the program to break down all the massive news to come out of this week's Nintendo
                        Direct presentation. Brian and Ben also chat about the latest Nintendo sales numbers, a Star Fox
                        64 sequel that never happened, and more.

                    <h3>Pacific Drive Preview – Dude, Where’s My Car? I’m Gonna Die</h3>
                    <p>
                        The reveal of Pacific Drive last year immediately grabbed me. I liked what I saw in the initial
                        trailer, sure, but what I found especially intriguing was that most of the game happens through
                        a first-person view of someone driving an old station wagon through a beautiful but distraught
                        Pacific Northwest forest. Rarely do driving games force a first-person view, and even fewer
                        deviate from being a racer.

                    <h3>Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom Expectations And Game Boy Games On Switch | GI Show</h3>
                    <p>
                        In this week's episode of The Game Informer Show, the crew excitedly outlines a few big reveals
                        from yesterday's Nintendo Direct, including flying machines in The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the
                        Kingdom and a collection of Game Boy games being released on Nintendo Switch yesterday alongside
                        a surprise launch of Metroid Prime Remastered. Following news of a canceled single-player
                        Titanfall game set in its shared universe with Apex Legends, the guys speculate about what
                        happened to the project and share their ideas for what the game could've looked like.
